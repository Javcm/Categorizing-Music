# Music classification using supervised learning methods

The data set consist on an extract  made by Dr. Victor Mu√±iz (CIMAT, MTY) from the Free Music Archive (FMA) data set with the following descriptions:

- Tracks (columns 1 to 23): Information of the song, album, artist, genre etc.

- Audio features (columns 24 to 31): Audio features of the song in the form of indicators. 

- Signal features (columns 31 to 549): Audio features of the song representing signal analysis properties in the form of statistics as average, estandar deviation, kurtosis, quartiles, etc.

First, it is present a brief unsupervised analysis of the audio features of the data set to look for interesting patterns, with an especific interest in the genre.

Next, a supervised analysis is made by using LDA, QDA, Multilogit & Neural Networks as classificators of the daneability & energy of the songs using as features de signal features of the songs.
